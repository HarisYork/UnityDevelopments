I'm not very good at licensing agreements... If you decide at your own risk to use an unoptimized piece of shit that I work on when I can't sleep (it's not just about this project). I will be very pleased to know about it.

I will try not to abandon this project, expand and improve the functionality, and finally finish the quest system, which is broken again!
Although I can't promise anything.

And yes, this seems to be my first commit in 2023.

By the sincere reader --
I greatly appreciate your effort and impressed by your scripts! After reading, they are truly marvelous regardless of how the state of optimization. I feel like they are usable in some ways and certain optimization may help to function the whole gaming contents, thank you very much!
